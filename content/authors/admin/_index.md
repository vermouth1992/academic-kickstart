I am 3rd year **PhD student** in **Computer Science** at **University of Southern California (USC)**. Currently, I am a research assistant working at [Data Science Lab](http://dslab.usc.edu) led by Professor [Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). Before joining USC, I received my bachlor degree from **Chien-Shiung Wu College at Southeast University**.

My research focus is **applied machine learning and data science**, especially **reinforcement learning** on energy systems. Besides, I am interested in **parallel computing** of deep learning algorithms on heterogeneous architectures.
